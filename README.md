# About
This repository is for the krunkbot team's maps. You can find screenshots and other info on the krunk.bot.nu website. These maps are constantly being updated.

# Maps
All the maps are an in-progress project; do a little here and there. We have some maps modeled after famous places, and due to editor limitations at this point, detail will suffer. If you wish to contribute anything, you can pull this repo down or email someone here, krunkbot@lerie.us, maybe they will get back to you.
